# Sunmi POS Research for Shisha Bar App

## Sunmi POS Models
Based on initial research, Sunmi offers various POS models that could be suitable for a shisha bar:

1. Sunmi V2s - Handheld device with Android 11, quad-core 2.0GHz CPU, 2GB RAM
   - Built-in printer
   - Suitable for mobile ordering
   - Good for waiters taking orders at tables

2. Sunmi V2 Pro - Similar to V2s with 58mm thermal printer
   - Print speed: 70mm/s
   - Android 7.1
   - Quad-core 1.4GHz processor

3. Sunmi T2 Mini - Countertop POS with 80mm printer
   - Android 7.1
   - Octa-core 1.4GHz processor
   - 2GB RAM + 16GB ROM

4. Sunmi D3 Pro - Larger display (15.6")
   - Android 13
   - Qualcomm hexa-core processor
   - 4GB RAM + 64GB ROM
   - Better for main counter/cashier station

## Restaurant Ordering System Integration
- Sunmi devices run on Android, making custom app development feasible
- Can integrate with restaurant management systems
- Support for order taking, checkout, and loyalty management
- Can be used for both mobile ordering (waiters) and fixed POS stations

## Development Considerations
- Need to develop Android app compatible with Sunmi OS (based on Android)
- Can use standard Android development tools (Android Studio, Java/Kotlin)
- Need to consider integration with printer for receipts
- Should design for both waiter mobile ordering and cashier station
- Need to implement separate receipt types for bar orders vs. shisha orders

## Next Steps
- Need more specific information about the Sunmi model being used
- Need to understand the workflow requirements in more detail
- Consider whether to use existing restaurant POS software or develop custom solution
- Research payment processing integration options
