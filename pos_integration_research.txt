# POS Integration Research for Shisha Bar App

## Sunmi L2 Integration
- Sunmi L2 runs on Android 7.1 with Qualcomm quad-core 1.4GHz processor
- 2GB RAM and 16GB ROM provides sufficient resources for a restaurant ordering app
- 5" display requires careful UI design for usability
- Sunmi provides developer documentation, though specific L2 documentation may be limited

## Receipt Printer Integration
- Sunmi devices typically include built-in thermal printers
- Need to integrate with Sunmi printer SDK for receipt generation
- Can create separate receipt templates for bar orders vs. shisha orders
- Should implement receipt customization options

## Android POS Development Considerations
- Standard Android development tools (Android Studio, Java/Kotlin) can be used
- Need to optimize for the specific hardware capabilities of Sunmi L2
- Consider memory limitations (2GB RAM) when designing app
- UI should be simple and elegant as requested by client

## Restaurant Ordering System Features
- Table management system for 20 regular tables + 2 game tables
- Waiter-based ordering system (not customer self-service)
- Customer call system for waiters
- Payment processing for cash, credit card, and EC card
- Inventory management with owner customization options

## Integration Approaches
1. **Custom Development Approach**:
   - Develop fully custom Android app specifically for Sunmi L2
   - Direct integration with device hardware (printer, scanner)
   - Complete control over UI/UX and features
   - Higher development effort but tailored to specific needs

2. **Existing POS Software Adaptation**:
   - Adapt existing restaurant POS solutions compatible with Android
   - May offer faster implementation but less customization
   - Need to verify compatibility with Sunmi L2 hardware
   - May require subscription fees

3. **Hybrid Approach**:
   - Use existing POS libraries/frameworks as foundation
   - Customize specific modules for shisha bar requirements
   - Balance between development speed and customization

## Recommended Approach
Based on the specific requirements (separate receipts for bar/shisha, customer call system, inventory management), a custom development approach is recommended to ensure all features can be implemented exactly as needed while maintaining the simple, elegant UI requested by the client.
